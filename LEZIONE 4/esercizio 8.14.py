'''Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one: car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True) Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

    return result
