'''5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
should look something like this:
car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
evaluates to True or False.
• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
5 tests evaluate to False.'''

fruit = 'apple'
print("Is fruit == 'apple'? I predict True.")
print(fruit == 'apple')


print("\nIs fruit == 'banana'? I predict False.")
print(fruit == 'banana')

name = 'john'
print("\nIs name.lower() == 'john'? I predict True.")
print(name.lower() == 'john')


print("\nIs name == 'John'? I predict False.")
print(name == 'John')

age = 25
print("\nIs age == 25? I predict True.")
print(age == 25)
